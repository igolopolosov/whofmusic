# Warehouse of Music

Music Sequencer and Sampler. `My diploma project of year 2015.`

## Windows Phone Mobile App

It's running under `Windows Phone 8.1`, it can be installed manually onto your mobile phone so you could try write simple melodies.

You have an options to add multiple tracks and manage your projects. You could do all basic CRUD actions for tracks, notes and projects.

Find the mobile app under [WarehouseOfMusic](https://github.com/usehotkey/whofmusic/tree/master/WarehouseOfMusic) folder.

## Generating sound

There is a small library which currently generates `angle wave ^^^` sound. It sounds like a saw and actually, sometimes it's called as a `saw` oscilattor. You can pitch the wave to the needed sound by manipulating frequency.

Find sound generating library under [WOMAudioComponent](https://github.com/usehotkey/whofmusic/tree/master/WOMAudioComponent) folder.
